## **Learn**


- Day 35 Challenge - MultiplicationGame  

Your goal is to build an “edutainment” app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – “what is 7 x 8?” and so on. Edutainment apps are educational at their code, but ideally have enough playfulness about them to make kids want to play.
  
### Breaking it down:
- The player needs to **select** which **multiplication tables** they want to practice. This could be pressing **buttons**, or it could be an “Up to…” **stepper**, going **from 2 to 12.**
- The player should be able to **select** how many **questions** they want to be asked: **5, 10, or 20**.
- You should **randomly** **generate** as many **questions** as they asked for, within the difficulty range they asked for.

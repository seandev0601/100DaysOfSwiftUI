This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning SwiftUI through the 100DaysOfSwiftUI challenge, as created by Paul Hudson. The goal of this challenge is to spend 100 days focusing on mastering SwiftUI and building practical iOS applications.

## **Overview**

SwiftUI is a modern and intuitive framework for building user interfaces across Apple platforms. With its declarative syntax and powerful features, it allows developers to create interactive and visually appealing apps with less code and in a more efficient manner.

In this repository, I will be documenting my progress as I work through the 100DaysOfSwiftUI challenge. Each day, I will tackle a new SwiftUI concept, explore its implementation, and build small projects to solidify my understanding. By the end of this challenge, I aim to have a strong foundation in SwiftUI and be capable of building robust iOS applications.

## **Repository Structure**

The repository will be organized into folders representing each project of the challenge. Inside each projectâ€™s folder, you will find the code and resources related to that specific topic. Additionally, I will provide detailed explanations and comments within the code to enhance the learning experience.

## **Tools and Requirements**

To follow along with this repository, you will need the following tools and software:

- **[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)** 14.3.1 (or later)
- iOS 16.0
- Swift 5.0
- SwiftUI 4.0

## **Progress Tracker**

To track my progress through the 100DaysOfSwiftUI challenge, I will update the following table with links to each project's code and associated project:

| Project | Topic | From Day |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| [01](01-Project01-WeSplit) | WeSplit | Day 16 - 18 |
| [Challenge](02-Challenge-UnitConversions) | Unit Conversions | Day 19 |

Each project's folder will contain the completed code and any relevant resources for that specific topic.

## **Resources**
Here are some additional resources that can help you further your understanding of SwiftUI:

- [Official Apple SwiftUI Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui)
- [Paul Hudson's 100DaysOfSwiftUI Course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

## **Contributions**

Contributions to this repository in the form of bug fixes, additional resources, or improvements to existing code are highly welcome. Feel free to open a pull request with your proposed changes, and I will review them as soon as possible.

## **Acknowledgements**

I would like to express my gratitude to Paul Hudson for creating the 100DaysOfSwiftUI challenge and providing valuable resources for learning SwiftUI. His dedication to teaching Swift and SwiftUI has been instrumental in my learning journey.

# **Project 1 - WeSplit**

In this project we’re going to be building a check-splitting app that you might use after eating at a restaurant – you enter the cost of your food, select how much of a tip you want to leave, and how many people you’re with, and it will tell you how much each person needs to pay.

    - Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
    - Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
    - Change the tip percentage picker to show a new screen rather than using a segmented control, and give it a wider range of options – everything from 0% to 100%. Tip: use the range 0..<101 for your range rather than a fixed array.
    - Make a new property to store the currency formatter.(**.currency(code: Locale.current.currencyCode ?? "USD")**)

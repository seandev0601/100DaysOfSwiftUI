# **Project 5 - Word Scramble**

This project will be another game, although really it’s just a sneaky way for me to introduce more Swift and SwiftUI knowledge! The game will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on.

    - Challenge
        - Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
        - Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
        - Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the player’s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
  
- Day 75 Fixing Word Scramble
  
    By **grouping the elements** and **customizing VoiceOver labels and hints**, the Word Scramble game now provides a much more natural and coherent experience for VoiceOver users.

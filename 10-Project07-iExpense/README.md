# **Project 7 - iExpense**

In this project we’re going to build iExpense, which is an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs. At its core this is an app with a form (how much did you spend?) and a list (here are the amounts you spent), but in order to accomplish those two things you’re going to need to learn how to:

    - Present and dismiss a second screen of data.
    - Delete rows from a list
    - Save and load user data
